For this assignment, we were asked to design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. We were given a 2D space that is 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar, and 3 pin supports (two of which to be mounted on the ground and the third mounted to a linear actuator chosen from a catalong). I set up the problem with an actuator that is 50cm long and has a max force value of 36kN. First, I found angle theta between the ground and the actuator. This then allowed me to find phi, the third triangle angle between the ground and the bar. Using that angle and the height of the system, I then found the length of the bar. After that, I took the moment about point R (the pin connecting the ground to the bar). This allowed me to solve for weight. I had already chosen the height of 30cm (somewhat arbitrary), so my maximum possible weight was 60 kN and my max possible height was 30cm.
