My name is Elinor Assadi and I am a sophomore from Seattle, WA studying civil engineering. On campus, I am a violinist in the Cornell Symphony, on the Cornell Seismic Design Project Team, and am involved in Hillel and the Center for Jewish Living. I plan to pursue a Master's degree in architecture and I aspire to be a structural engineer in an architecture firm.
